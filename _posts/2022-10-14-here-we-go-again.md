I'm not a man of many talents, but if there's one thing I'm doing consistently over the last 15 years is starting a new blog. I'm also pretty consistent in completely ignoring it just a few months after its first post, but that's not the focus here. Here I'm trying to convince you that this blog will stick.

And if starting a blog in an age when nobody reads blogs anymore is not an offense big enough, I'm starting it with a post completely empty of any actual content. I'm sorry, it's stronger than me. I would feel like a savage if I started a blog without an introductory post stating what the blog will be about, even though I have no idea at this point. All I know is this is a personal blog, so you can expect my personal opinion about basically anything.

By the way, since this is a personal blog, it makes sense to tell you a little bit about the person behind it. My name is Elomar, and I'm a software developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I've been writing software for more than 15 years, and I'm still having fun doing it. I'm also particularly passionate about creating products, so you can expect some posts about this as well. In case you want to know more about me, I've written [a needlessly long about page](/about).

And... that's it. See you in the next post!
